  <h1>Avocado Toast</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>When avocado toast came onto the scene years ago, lots of people wrote it off as a trend. But as someone who still eats it for breakfast or lunch a few times a week, I have to say that I think avocado toast is here to stay! It’s super easy to make, it’s healthy and satisfying, and it’s a blank canvas for flavorful seasonal toppings. What’s not to love?</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
    <li>Lemon wedge, for squeezing</li>
    <li>Sea salt</li>
    <li>2 to 4 slices toasted bread</li>
    <li>Desired toppings, optional</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Halve the avocado vertically and remove the pit. Use a small knife to dice the avocado flesh while it's still inside the skin. Season the flesh with a squeeze of lemon juice and sprinkle it with sea salt.</li>
    <li>Scoop the diced avocado flesh out of the skin and onto the toasted bread. Mash the avocado with the back of a fork and top with your desired toppings.</li>
  </ol>
