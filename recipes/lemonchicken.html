  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 chicken thighs skin on and bone-in</li>
    <li>¼ cup lemon juice juice of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic crushed</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons dried basil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt plus extra</li>
    <li>8 baby potatoes halved</li>
    <li>1 red onion cut into wedges</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper deseeded and cut into wedges</li>
    <li>1 zucchini large, sliced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons pitted Kalamata olives</li>
    <li>4 lemon slices to serve</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pat thighs dry with paper towel. In a shallow dish, combine the lemon juice, 2 tablespoon of olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, oregano, parsley and salt. Pour out half of the marinade and store in a jug to use later.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken to the marinade in the dish and coat evenly. Cover and marinate for 15 minutes if rushed; 1 hour if time allows; or over night, turning each chicken thigh occasionally in the marinade.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 220°C | 430°F. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large oven-proof pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides until golden browned (about 4 minutes each side). Drain some of the excess fat, leaving about a tablespoon for added flavour.</li>
    <li>Arrange the vegetables around each chicken thigh. Drizzle the vegetables with the remaining marinade, tossing them through the oil mixture to evenly coat.</li>
    <li>Cover skillet or dish with lid (or foil), and bake until the potatoes are soft and the chicken is completely cooked through (about 35 minutes). Change oven setting to grill / broil on a medium heat setting; uncover and cook for about 5-10 minutes, or until chicken and potatoes are crispy and golden browned. Serve with olives and lemon slices.</li>
  </ol>
